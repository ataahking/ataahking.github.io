> **Editor's Note**: *This is an official press release by REIGNSOUNDXL<sup class="tm">TM</sup> covering Reignsound<sup class="tm">TM</sup> Records rapper [ATAAH KING](https://www.google.com/search?q=ataah+king&oq=ATAAH+KING). See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/reignsoundpress/reignsoundpress.github.io/commits/main) for a list of revisions and ongoing edits*.

Prior to his trial, ATAAH KING, the *Not One*<sup class="tm">TM</sup> and *Favorite Rapper*<sup class="tm">TM</sup> rapper, was in talks with Sony<sup class="tmr">&reg;</sup>, via AWAL<sup class="tmr">&reg;</sup> and The Orchard<sup class="tmr">&reg;</sup>, regarding the release of a forthcoming project.

The project, a cinematic continuation of [50 Cent](https://www.google.com/search?q=ataah+king&oq=50+Cent)'s *Get Rich or Die Tryin*'<sup class="tmr">&reg;</sup>, was set to reimagine the genre-defining debut through the lens of an emerging icon in the modern era.

This release was intended to follow a promotional campaign titled the *Year-Long Singles Run* project, in which the rapper would release singles weekly for a year.

Initially the project was abruptly halted due to legal challenges, but the rapper and his team have continued efforts to resume business as planned.
