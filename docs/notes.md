## June 8th, 2025

ATAAH KING's scripture notes for Saturday, June 8th, 2025:

---

### Genesis 1:1

---

#### Importance / Significance

This chapter is important because:

* It explains where God fits in, in the grand scheme of things
* It sets the stage for what God expects from us (humans/people)

---

#### Active Recall

*When I read **Genesis 1:1**, I think about*:

* How God created Heaven (the Hereafter) and Earth (right now)
* How <mark>God exists beyond space and time</mark>
    * Since God created the Heaven and the Earth, God exists beyond these/such things
    * God always is, was, and will be
    * God is omnipresent
        * "*God created*..."
            * Before these things existed, God existed
        * "*And the spirit of God moved upon*..."
            * The presence of God was with God's creation
                * "e.g., *<mark>God was with God's creation</mark>*"

---

#### Reflection

* This is a point I wanted to meditate on, because this is God's creation. The creation in and of itself is perfect, as designed and intended by God. So after this chapter ended, I stopped reading and meditated on the word.

* I've head before that to God, "*a thousand years is like a second&mdash;or a day, etc.*"
    * Simply suggesting <mark>our perception of time and God's is not the same</mark>
    * The creation story takes course over 6 days; however, science suggests that it may have been hundreds of thousands, or millions, of years between the creation of Earth and the first appearance of humans
    * I believe this may be scripture somewhere in the Bible (when I find it, I will link to it. I know time is referenced in such a manner in the Qur'an as well)
