Scripture notes for Saturday, June 8th, 2025:

Last time (a couple days ago, maybe yesterday) I read the Bible, I left off at **Genesis 1:1**.

    This chapter is important because:

    * It sets the stage for what God expects from us (humans/people)

Today I plan to continue reading from where I left off.

First, I'll re-read chapter one and recall thoughts I had from my previous reading.
